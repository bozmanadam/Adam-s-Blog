                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Blockchain Revolution</h2>

                    <blockquote>“Step aside, bitcoin. There’s another digital token in town that’s winning over the hearts and wallets of cryptocurrency enthusiasts across the globe.”</blockquote>

                    <p>Amidst my disappointing outlook as a new college graduate is the continual approach of would-be entrepreneurs. They come across all axes and in every form. Friends from college want someone, anyone to back their idea; friends from high school just assume that a college graduate can make their idea happen. It appears, to me at least, that the entrepreneurial spirit is as alive in my generation as in any previous one.</p>

                    <p>Along with that optimism appears very little initiative to save, to invest. At least, there is little investment in the long term. However, the short term looks promising for now. Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin being the staple, have flourished in the last three months. They’re developing everywhere, and markets to trade them are as well.</p>

                    <p>I prefer to stack my odds on the little guy, so something I’ve been continually researching is the Golem Network. A company out of Poland, they offer a unique building opportunity. Peer-to-peer computer sharing is conceptually a brilliant idea, but I’m just worried about the security. Regardless of its security, I can still purchase Golem currency and it will be fractional to what Bitcoin is worth now. If it works well though then I imagine it will be one of Bitcoin’s top competitors.</p>

                    <p>I encourage you to checkout Golem’s work <a href="https://golem.network/">here</a>, and an article about the block chain revolution <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-31/bitcoin-risks-being-eclipsed-by-digital-coin-cousin-ethereum">here</a>.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Atom, GitHub, and about twenty different ways to not make a website</h2>

                    <p>What’s that old quote from Ben Franklin, “I didn’t fail at making a light bulb, I discovered 2,000 ways to not make a light bulb”?  Yeah, I did that. I’ve made a website before. In fact, I’ve made a couple. I’ve used sites like Wix.com and Weebly.com, and I’ve forked sites off GitHub. No big deal, at least I didn’t think so. A template site is a template site, regardless of where you get it.</p>

                    <p>Well, that much is true, but one thing to keep in mind is the destination of your project. You need to know what you want your website to do. This is tricky, and this is something I hadn’t done before.</p>

                    <p>Tasked with building the ecommerce website of a hypothetical wine importation business, I was grossly overconfident. Not only did I have zero competence in the realm of ecommerce, but I had zero vision of the website. I build informational pages, home pages, index.html type stuff.</p>

                    <p>So, I need ecommerce. I guess I start with the product? No, I need to start with the homepage. Sure, but neither of those are worth anything if I don’t have a functional shopping cart and checkout. Oh, and how the hell am I supposed to accept someone’s credit card info? Let alone assure them that I’m protecting their information? Suddenly I have an entirely new respect for the design of Nike’s webpage, one that I examined before my initial efforts. Rows, columns, chapters, delving in between countries and product categories, all while looking immaculate; my sincerest appreciation to those developers in Beaverton.</p>

                    <p>Can I just use a template? I asked naïvely. Yeah, sure you can, but that template doesn’t exist. The template of a dozen different html pages that redirect to one another seamlessly with responsive, intuitive design doesn’t exist. Maybe little templates pieced together? I’ll take the bootstrap layout for a card reading system, a comprehensive homepage, and intuitive shopping categories. Nope, that’s sloppy and doesn’t work.</p>

                    <p>At this point I’ve exhausted days, and I’ve learned more than I ever cared to about the inner workings of a digital shopping cart. I still haven’t learned what I set out for, but that isn’t to say I haven’t learned anything. Amidst the progressively dismal outlook, my project gave me a shocking amount of confidence and comfort. Not only had a built a webpage using Atom and posted it to GitHub Pages, but I had built twenty-four of them. At this point it was second nature.</p>

                    <p>The next step in the process is only majorly disappointing. I stopped, but I didn’t give up on the project. I took a page from the book of every procrastinator, and I changed the project. I tailored it to my own. I needed ecommerce but nothing at all resembling Nike’s website. This is a small business; it’s new to the market. The brand image matters more than the functionality of the checkout system. People don’t trust unfamiliar sites anyways. Bingo! I’ll make an agency-style bootstrap template (which I’ve done about six of at this point). It’ll be something recognizable and informative, but it doesn’t need to do the checkout. People trust Amazon more anyways. Let them get the use out of their prime membership.</p>

                    <p>There you have it, a couple of hours later and I’m done! Well, I’m mostly done. I finished the basic structure and layout. It’s good enough for an initial design, but I’ll need to change some things eventually. I kept it mostly stock/google image photos, and my text is minimal. The best part, I can just link each product to an amazon page. I don’t even have to worry about the shipping! Bottom line, I’m happy. I don’t care that it took me a week to build something that I could’ve built in a few hours. It’s mine, and I understand the business better than ever because of it.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What's the next step?</h2>

                    <p>The advice of our commencement speaker, Sherman Alexie, “remember your promises.” A sobering tone that rang through the floor of the Spokane Arena, Alexie recalled his childhood as a poor Indian boy. He recognized his success as an author could only be attributed to those catalysts of his growth, those people that made him promises.</p>

                    <blockquote>“They said, ‘You work hard, stranger, and you will graduate. You work hard, stranger, and we’ll help you get to the next rung on the ladder... That town made me promises and it kept them.”</blockquote>

                    <p>The mixture of expressions across students nearest me on the floor included a combination of disinterest, shame, and provocation. This adequately summed up the varying but general dispositions of Gonzaga students regarding racial condemnations and controversial subjects. Mr. Alexie’s message was not one of promise and prestige, but it was one of responsibility and integrity. Fittingly, it addressed our recent graduates.</p>

                    <p>It’s been a little over two weeks since I left the stadium that day, and my prospects for work are still minimal. Oddly, or perhaps intentionally, the message given that day rings clearer than ever right now. In its continual circulation through my thoughts the idea of promises calms my nerves of the future. The idea of promises provides a goal for today, and for tomorrow. It is a responsibility, and it is one I hope to never mistreat. My responsibility remains to those people that help me and to those people that may need my help. Without knowing anything else of my next few months, I know that I will continue to be a person that welcomes strangers at my front door.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Doge-tastic</h2>

                    <p>Because this posting is somewhat dry and depressing, here's a picture of my favorite dog. It's a Leonberger!</p>

                    <a href="#">

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What's the purpose of a blog?</h2>

                    <p>Tasked with this assignment in conjunction with a digital marketing class, I have a defined purpose for my blog. Specifically, I log and review the progress of my coursework here. I imagine that others utalize blogs for personal organization as well. However, the uniquely enabled blog user possesses something more trancending, a previously intangible advantage. With the abilitiy to brainstorm, type, and push ideals and propoganda to the world in real time, the blogger is the contemporary poet and journalist.</p>
