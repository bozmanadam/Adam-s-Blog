                    <h2 class="section-heading">Sign Up/Login on Bubble</h2>

                    <p>CheckOut as an application offers multiple benefits to the user, but the initial introduction requires a signup/login page and allows for a user to navigate between the two and log out at their will. Because my application only works in coordination with a third party, I pushed this signup/login page out to receive some feedback on my signup system and my landing page. To make sure there was no confusion from the CheckOut system, I isolated the signup/login as a new application. This is all users view now when I push it out to friends and family. The responses were unanimously positive and congratulatory!</p>

                    <blockquote>“It worked!”</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>“Yup, worked like a dream.”</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>"I signed up and it sent me an email! I like the personal message from you when I sign up."</blockquote>

                    <p>Now, it’s nice to know that the signup system is welcoming, but there are certainly still issues. My navigation within the system lacks some coherency. It is also difficult to provide a description for the service, and it is something that I’m not sure if I should include.</p>

                    <p>Say this service is pushed out as an app, it likely has a common understanding. Assuming there is a description in the app store, a previous prompting to download the app as well, I think I could assume that the user understands the purpose of CheckOut. Still, I need to make sure they understand navigation within the system. So, I can avoid a comprehensive description, but I still need to demonstrate the functions of the app. I’ve debated whether to include descriptors, or try to prompt a tutorial of the apps functions. Where I’m at, I’m not sure which would work better.</p>

                    <p>The feedback of my application idea has been mixed, but almost always varies in my suggested target market. Often my critique only varies in where I will implement the system, big or small markets. This will be a decision that determines much of CheckOut’s capabilities. I prefer to go big first. It seems like the kind of thing that, if it works well, is scalable. I wouldn’t want to let anyone else capture competing markets.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">A Few Weeks With Bubble</h2>

                    <p>Bubble.is provided an opportunity to develop and push through my ideas for websites and apps. I can equate it best to a fully customizable wix, wordpress, or weebly website. While it is a drag-and-drop style of builder, it’s unique in that the drag-and-drop motion has no applied function. It allows for unique, particular design.</p>

                    <p>It’s difficult to measure my success in using bubble.is because it was a continuously stressful process. Coming out of Gonzaga as a Philosophy major, I like to think (and I would hope) that I am able to think and reason logically. With that, I should be able to structure my thought in such a way that is conducive to app/website development, and I think it does. Although, utilizing bubble.is, an app that promotes and advocates for website development without code, uses its own unique syntax. Albeit easier, I’m sure, the leg work that’s involved in understanding the abilities and structure behind bubble.is is certainly not covered in their tutorials page.</p>

                    <p>The upside? Of any tool that I was asked to utilize in this course, bubble.is was the most responsive and intuitive. Its own structure was intuitive after a while, and their “bubble forum” cleared up nearly all questions I had. Still, I imagine the good majority of my time was spent in the forum researching and not in the UI development section.</p>

                    <p>The upside again? I think that having overcome a good majority of that learning curve and having confidence in my own skills regarding the bubble system will allow me to implement my ideas quicker in the future.</p>

                    <p>My advice, lay out your plan. Like a blueprint for anything, a predevelopment structure of your application benefits your development process.</p>

                    <p>If there’s anything that I can visualize then it something worth pursuing. Even with what seemed like barriers within the bubble.is framework, this tool enables the user, any user to further their idea(s). In my brainstorming process I came up with an application idea that I was really proud of, CheckOut. Sparing the details of the application, CheckOut was and continuous to be something that seems viable as a business. Because I haven’t mastered the bubble.is framework entirely, CheckOut does not operate exactly as I would like. Now that my academic obligations are over with, I plan to continue developing CheckOut. While I would love to push the app to the general public, I will continue its development for my own goals. I am convinced that even if nothing comes of it CheckOut will be a worthwhile challenge to accomplish. Moreover, I imagine that having the app’s development on a resume can only benefit me in the future. </p>

                    <p>I’m certainly thankful for the opportunity that bubble.is has provided me.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Bubble.is</h2>

                    <p>Is this the future of app development? This is amazing! Unlike appyet.com, the UI/UX is there and it is magical. It flows so well. If ever there was a time that I thought my logic training in philosophy might come in handy, it is now.</p>

                    <p>How do you start to build an app without experience? Well, you build the structure in your head then you use bubble.is to help with the development. The logistical set up of the development tool is unparalleled, and the layered approach to its structure is intuitive. I’m a fan. What could make this tool any better? Oh, they have the best supporting cast on the internet. What’s more? They have tutorials! Below is a plugin that I was just walked through via their tutorial page and the tutorial page itself.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Struggle of appyet.com</h2>

                    <p><i>The incredible power that comes with appyet.com and appetize.io is unreal, but the user experience leaves something to be desired. It feels like some sort of divine transcendence, the ability to develop and test and app so easily. Although, I think it’s a little too enthusiastic and too optimistic. Trying to develop a simple RSS feed for weeks now, off and on, but I haven’t been able to create one entirely successful build. This is fair, I’m not a developer nor particularly computer savvy. I would have imagined that the support for the building stage would be more present or uniform than it is. Whatever the future of appyet.com holds, I suggest to its maintainers that they look at something like bubble.is for their future inspiration. Not regarding function at all, but just with user experience bubble.is is miles ahead of appyet.com.</i></p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Blockchain Revolution</h2>

                    <blockquote>“Step aside, bitcoin. There’s another digital token in town that’s winning over the hearts and wallets of cryptocurrency enthusiasts across the globe.”</blockquote>

                    <p>Amidst my disappointing outlook as a new college graduate is the continual approach of would-be entrepreneurs. They come across all axes and in every form. Friends from college want someone, anyone to back their idea; friends from high school just assume that a college graduate can make their idea happen. It appears, to me at least, that the entrepreneurial spirit is as alive in my generation as in any previous one.</p>

                    <p>Along with that optimism appears very little initiative to save, to invest. At least, there is little investment in the long term. However, the short term looks promising for now. Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin being the staple, have flourished in the last three months. They’re developing everywhere, and markets to trade them are as well.</p>

                    <p>I prefer to stack my odds on the little guy, so something I’ve been continually researching is the Golem Network. A company out of Poland, they offer a unique building opportunity. Peer-to-peer computer sharing is conceptually a brilliant idea, but I’m just worried about the security. Regardless of its security, I can still purchase Golem currency and it will be fractional to what Bitcoin is worth now. If it works well though then I imagine it will be one of Bitcoin’s top competitors.</p>

                    <p>I encourage you to checkout Golem’s work <a href="https://golem.network/">here</a>, and an article about the block chain revolution <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-31/bitcoin-risks-being-eclipsed-by-digital-coin-cousin-ethereum">here</a>.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Atom, GitHub, and about twenty different ways to not make a website</h2>

                    <p>What’s that old quote from Ben Franklin, “I didn’t fail at making a light bulb, I discovered 2,000 ways to not make a light bulb”?  Yeah, I did that. I’ve made a website before. In fact, I’ve made a couple. I’ve used sites like Wix.com and Weebly.com, and I’ve forked sites off GitHub. No big deal, at least I didn’t think so. A template site is a template site, regardless of where you get it.</p>

                    <p>Well, that much is true, but one thing to keep in mind is the destination of your project. You need to know what you want your website to do. This is tricky, and this is something I hadn’t done before.</p>

                    <p>Tasked with building the ecommerce website of a hypothetical wine importation business, I was grossly overconfident. Not only did I have zero competence in the realm of ecommerce, but I had zero vision of the website. I build informational pages, home pages, index.html type stuff.</p>

                    <p>So, I need ecommerce. I guess I start with the product? No, I need to start with the homepage. Sure, but neither of those are worth anything if I don’t have a functional shopping cart and checkout. Oh, and how the hell am I supposed to accept someone’s credit card info? Let alone assure them that I’m protecting their information? Suddenly I have an entirely new respect for the design of Nike’s webpage, one that I examined before my initial efforts. Rows, columns, chapters, delving in between countries and product categories, all while looking immaculate; my sincerest appreciation to those developers in Beaverton.</p>

                    <p>Can I just use a template? I asked naïvely. Yeah, sure you can, but that template doesn’t exist. The template of a dozen different html pages that redirect to one another seamlessly with responsive, intuitive design doesn’t exist. Maybe little templates pieced together? I’ll take the bootstrap layout for a card reading system, a comprehensive homepage, and intuitive shopping categories. Nope, that’s sloppy and doesn’t work.</p>

                    <p>At this point I’ve exhausted days, and I’ve learned more than I ever cared to about the inner workings of a digital shopping cart. I still haven’t learned what I set out for, but that isn’t to say I haven’t learned anything. Amidst the progressively dismal outlook, my project gave me a shocking amount of confidence and comfort. Not only had a built a webpage using Atom and posted it to GitHub Pages, but I had built twenty-four of them. At this point it was second nature.</p>

                    <p>The next step in the process is only majorly disappointing. I stopped, but I didn’t give up on the project. I took a page from the book of every procrastinator, and I changed the project. I tailored it to my own. I needed ecommerce but nothing at all resembling Nike’s website. This is a small business; it’s new to the market. The brand image matters more than the functionality of the checkout system. People don’t trust unfamiliar sites anyways. Bingo! I’ll make an agency-style bootstrap template (which I’ve done about six of at this point). It’ll be something recognizable and informative, but it doesn’t need to do the checkout. People trust Amazon more anyways. Let them get the use out of their prime membership.</p>

                    <p>There you have it, a couple of hours later and I’m done! Well, I’m mostly done. I finished the basic structure and layout. It’s good enough for an initial design, but I’ll need to change some things eventually. I kept it mostly stock/google image photos, and my text is minimal. The best part, I can just link each product to an amazon page. I don’t even have to worry about the shipping! Bottom line, I’m happy. I don’t care that it took me a week to build something that I could’ve built in a few hours. It’s mine, and I understand the business better than ever because of it.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What's the next step?</h2>

                    <p>The advice of our commencement speaker, Sherman Alexie, “remember your promises.” A sobering tone that rang through the floor of the Spokane Arena, Alexie recalled his childhood as a poor Indian boy. He recognized his success as an author could only be attributed to those catalysts of his growth, those people that made him promises.</p>

                    <blockquote>“They said, ‘You work hard, stranger, and you will graduate. You work hard, stranger, and we’ll help you get to the next rung on the ladder... That town made me promises and it kept them.”</blockquote>

                    <p>The mixture of expressions across students nearest me on the floor included a combination of disinterest, shame, and provocation. This adequately summed up the varying but general dispositions of Gonzaga students regarding racial condemnations and controversial subjects. Mr. Alexie’s message was not one of promise and prestige, but it was one of responsibility and integrity. Fittingly, it addressed our recent graduates.</p>

                    <p>It’s been a little over two weeks since I left the stadium that day, and my prospects for work are still minimal. Oddly, or perhaps intentionally, the message given that day rings clearer than ever right now. In its continual circulation through my thoughts the idea of promises calms my nerves of the future. The idea of promises provides a goal for today, and for tomorrow. It is a responsibility, and it is one I hope to never mistreat. My responsibility remains to those people that help me and to those people that may need my help. Without knowing anything else of my next few months, I know that I will continue to be a person that welcomes strangers at my front door.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What's the purpose of a blog?</h2>

                    <p>Tasked with this assignment in conjunction with a digital marketing class, I have a defined purpose for my blog. Specifically, I log and review the progress of my coursework here. I imagine that others utalize blogs for personal organization as well. However, the uniquely enabled blog user possesses something more trancending, a previously intangible advantage. With the abilitiy to brainstorm, type, and push ideals and propoganda to the world in real time, the blogger is the contemporary poet and journalist.</p>
